# Random Smashdown Web Application

I wanted to create a version of my Python Random Smashdown Selector program using React + Vite so people can use it on their phone or computer with a nice looking UI

The purpose/inspiration for this project is to randomly select a fighter, from the game Super Smash Bros Ultimate for Nintendo Switch, for the player like the in-game mode Smash Down.
Yes the game has a random feature but I like to pick which color I want to use. This allows me to do so lol
The roster will decrease in size, deleting the randomly selected fighter, ensuring you dont get a duplicate fighter selection.
This could also just be used with friends to diversify gameplay!

Still a W.I.P. so stay tuned for updates!
