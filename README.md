# Random Smashdown Web Application

I wanted to create a version of my Python Random Smashdown Selector program using React + Vite so people can use it on their phone or computer with a nice looking UI

The purpose/inspiration for this project is to randomly select a fighter, from the game Super Smash Bros Ultimate for Nintendo Switch, for the player.
Yes the game has a random feature but I like to pick which color I want to use. This allows me to do so lol
The roster will also decrease in size as the selected fighter will be removed from the fighter list to ensure you dont get a duplicate. Similar to the Smashdown mode in the game.

Still a W.I.P. so stay tuned for updates!
